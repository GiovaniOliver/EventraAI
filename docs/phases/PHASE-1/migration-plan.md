# Next.js Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed plan for migrating the EventraAI application from its current Express+Vite+React architecture to Next.js, while maintaining all existing functionality and improving the developer and user experience.

## Current Architecture

### Frontend
- React 18.3.1
- Vite for development and bundling
- wouter for client-side routing
- React Query for data fetching
- Custom WebSocket implementation for real-time features
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Backend
- Express.js server
- Supabase for database and authentication
- WebSocket server integrated with Express

### Key Issues
- Integration between Vite and Express causing frontend rendering issues
- Conflicting WebSocket implementations
- Development environment complexity
- No server-side rendering capability

## Target Architecture

### Next.js Application
- App Router for improved routing
- Server Components for performance
- API Routes replacing Express endpoints
- Middleware for authentication
- Continued use of Supabase for database
- Streamlined WebSocket implementation or Supabase Realtime

## Migration Steps

### 1. Project Setup (Priority: High)
- Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- Configure Tailwind CSS
- Set up project structure:
  - `/app` - App Router pages and layouts
  - `/app/api` - API routes
  - `/components` - UI components
  - `/lib` - Utilities and helpers
  - `/hooks` - Custom hooks
  - `/public` - Static assets

### 2. Supabase Integration (Priority: High)
- Set up Supabase client
- Configure environment variables
- Create authentication helpers

### 3. Authentication System (Priority: High)
- Implement Next.js middleware for protected routes
- Create authentication context provider
- Migrate login/register/logout functionality

### 4. API Routes (Priority: High)
- Convert Express endpoints to Next.js API routes
- Implement proper error handling
- Set up middleware for authentication

### 5. Component Migration (Priority: Medium)
- Convert React components to use Next.js patterns
- Split between Client and Server components
- Update imports and paths

### 6. Real-time Communication (Priority: Medium)
- Evaluate options:
  - Implement WebSockets with Next.js API routes
  - Use Supabase Realtime
  - Consider Server-Sent Events or other alternatives
- Implement chosen solution
- Migrate existing real-time features

### 7. Routing Implementation (Priority: Medium)
- Set up Next.js App Router structure
- Implement layouts and templates
- Create dynamic routes
- Set up loading and error states

### 8. Deployment Strategy (Priority: Low)
- Configure build settings
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Deploy to hosting platform (Vercel recommended)

## Dependencies and Constraints

- Must maintain Supabase integration
- All existing features must be preserved
- UI/UX should remain consistent
- Authentication flow must remain secure
- Performance should be maintained or improved

## Technical Considerations

### TypeScript Configuration
- Ensure proper type definitions
- Maintain strong typing throughout the application

### State Management
- Continue using React Query for server state
- Use React Context for global state

### SEO and Performance
- Implement proper metadata
- Use Next.js optimizations for images and fonts
- Implement proper caching strategies

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for components and utilities
- Integration tests for key flows
- End-to-end tests for critical paths

## Rollback Plan
- Maintain original codebase in separate branch
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Plan for quick reversion if needed

## Success Criteria
- All existing functionality works in Next.js version
- Frontend renders correctly
- Performance meets or exceeds current implementation
- Developer experience is improved
- User experience is maintained or enhanced
