# @memories.md - Development History

This file tracks the comprehensive history of development activities, user interactions, and technical decisions for the EventraAI project.

- [v1.0.0] Development: Initiated project migration planning from Express+Vite+React to Next.js by conducting extensive codebase analysis, documenting existing functionality including authentication system with Supabase backend, WebSocket integration for real-time collaboration, React components library, wouter-based routing, React Query for data management, Express-based REST API endpoints, and database services; identified integration issues between Vite and Express, WebSocket conflicts, UI rendering problems, and development environment challenges; proposed migration approach to leverage Next.js features like server-side rendering, integrated API routes, and improved routing system.

- [v1.0.1] Development: Created comprehensive documentation structure in `/docs` directory including memories.md for development history, lessons-learned.md for technical insights, scratchpad.md for task management with prioritized tasks ID-001 through ID-008, and project-requirements.md detailing specifications; established phase-based documentation in `/docs/phases/PHASE-1` including migration-plan.md with detailed Next.js migration approach, architecture-comparison.md with visual architecture comparisons, and component-migration-guide.md providing step-by-step component conversion instructions with code examples and best practices.

- [v1.0.2] Development: Created new Next.js project in eventra-next directory using create-next-app with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, App Router, src directory structure, and @/* import alias configuration as foundation for the migration; initial setup successfully completed as Step 1 of the migration plan, establishing the base project structure for subsequent implementation of Supabase integration, authentication system, API routes, and component migration.
